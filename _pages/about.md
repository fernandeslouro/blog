My name is Jo√£o Louro. I live in Chaveirinha, a small village in Portugal, and I am 24 years old. In this blog, I hope to write about my interests. This would include machine-learning related articles, maybe some accompanying documents for any projects I develop, and the occasional thought on life as I'm living it.
