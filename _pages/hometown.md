This is a satellite picture of Mação, my home region, taken on 2021-08-27. It is the latest available image from ESA's 
Sentinel 2 satellites. It's kept updated using some [scripts](https://github.com/fernandeslouro/terras) I made to have 
something on my website to mark the passage of time. It all runs on a rented server I also use to self-host some 
services.

In the summer months, the picture will appear very brown. Most of the area was burned in recent wildfires, and it shows 
when the grass dies. In winter, it turns greener, but there's not a lot of forest now. The population is also shrinking 
at an alarming pace.

I grew up here, and I have love for this land. You should visit if you have the chance.
