This is a satellite imge from my home region. This image is the latest available image from ESA's Sentinel 2 satellites.
 It's kept updated using some [scripts](https://github.com/fernandeslouro/terras) I made. I made this as a litte project
 to entertain myself, and to have a little something on my website to remember myself of the passage of time.

In the summer months, the picture will appear very brown. This is due to the recent wildfires wich burned most of the 
area. In winter, it turns greener, but there's not a lot of forest at the moment. The population is also shrinking at an
 alarming pace.

 I grew up here, and I have love for this land. You should visit if you have the chance.
