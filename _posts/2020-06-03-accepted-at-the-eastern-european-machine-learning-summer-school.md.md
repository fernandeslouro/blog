I just got accepted to the [Eastern European Machine Learning Summer School](https://www.eeml.eu/)! This event (which will be hosted virtually this year) will happen 1-9 July 2020. 

The panel of speakers is illustrious, and includes (just to name a few) [Yoshua Bengio](https://yoshuabengio.org/), [David Silver](https://www.davidsilver.uk/) and [Alex Graves](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=DaFHynwAAAAJ&hl=en).

The sessions will be available only to participants during the school. However, the recordings will be made publicly available after the event ends. 

Besides lectures and socializing events, the school will include tutorial sessions, 1:1 mentoring, virtual booths for companies, and more. I hope to deepen my knowledge in Deep Learning and Deep Reinforcement Learning (one of the major subjects approached at the school, and one I'm really into) and meet other practitioners. Pretty exciting stuff.
