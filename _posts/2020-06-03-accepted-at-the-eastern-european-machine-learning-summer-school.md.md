I just got accepted to the [Eastern European Machine Learning Summer School](https://www.eeml.eu/)! This event (which will be hosted virtually this year) will happen 1-9 July 2020. 

The panel of speakers is illustrious, and includes (just to name a few) [Yoshua Bengio](https://yoshuabengio.org/), [David Silver](https://www.davidsilver.uk/) and [Alex Graves](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=DaFHynwAAAAJ&hl=en).

Besides lectures and socializing events, the school will include poster sessions, tutorial sessions, discussions on best practices, panel discussions, 1:1 mentoring sessions, virtual booths for companies, and more. The school will offer the opportunity to gain visibility and network with peers and top researchers in the field through social events and poster sessions.

During the school, participants will be exposed to both fundamental and advanced topics related to machine learning. By the end of the school, participants are expected to:
 * be familiar with terminology used in the field (e.g., BPTT, off/on policy, etc.);
 * have a good understanding of basic and some more advanced notions in Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning;
 * understand what are the open questions in the field and what are the emergent topics;
 * be exposed to some of the theoretical underpinnings and latest developments in the theoretical study of deep neural networks;
 * be familiar with commonly-used neural networks;
 * understand good practices for setting up learning experiments (e.g., getting baselines, hyper-param tuning, etc.);
 * be able to design, train and test a neural network for a specific task using TensorFlow;
 * be able to analyse and diagnose network behaviour (e.g., overfitting).
