title: Reviewing my Steelcase Please V2 (Refurbished) Chair
tags: [irl]
---

Some time ago, I decided to invest some money on a better chair. I mostly work from home, so this was important for me. I had made up my mind that I was going to spend an amount I would be embarassed to say I spent on a chair. The price for a Steelcase chair is 1000€+.

I decided to check used markets, and ended up buying a refurbished Steelcase Please V2 after reading [this review](https://blog.szynalski.com/2017/09/review-steelcase-please/). I don´t regret it.
