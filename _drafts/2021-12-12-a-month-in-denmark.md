title: Spending Time in Denmark

As of late, I have been spending some time in Denmark. My girlfriend Maria is taking a Master's at Copenhagen Business School, and since I work remotely, I started to be there for extended periods of time. I've been in Copenhagen most of the time, but I also been a trip by bus and train to Billund for a flight (that's where Legoland is). While I prefer hotter, more rural areas, I could imagine myself living in Copenhagen. 

We have friends from Portugal who we visit often. They are living in an especially nice (in my opinion) part of Copenhagen. Flydedokken, which is close to the canals. Last year I got a chance to swim in the canals, which is something the locals do often.

On my last visit, I had a flight in Billund, which is three hours away from Copenhagen by train and bus. Unfortunately, there was a big smowfall the night before I took the train, which damaged some electric cables. My train was stopped in its tracks. I missed my flight because of that.

I'll likely be going back soon, to get a taste of the nordic winter.
